Libertine
=========

An app managing support for legacy Ubuntu applications in a Snappy Personal
environment.

Legacy application support is performed through containers which provide a
sandboxed chroot-style environment that supports DEB packages and an X11 socket.
One or more of these environments can be configured, and each environment can
container one or more installed applications.
