  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Allow an explicitly set distro during the create operation if it matches the
    host's distro even if the distro is technically end-of-life. (LP: #1569397)
  * More Libertine GUI improvements.
  * Check to make sure a subcommand was given and if not, print out the usage.
    (LP: #1539104)
  * Check to see if CLI and GUI is ran using sudo and if so, print a message and
    exit. (LP: #1570548)
  * Catch runtime errors raised when starting a container so a crash file is not
    generated and to tell the GUI that there was an error so the user can be
    presented a proper notification. (LP: #1539105)
  * Use shutil.which() instead of hardcoded path for detecting if proot is on the
    system. Fixes alternate $PATH locations such as in a snap. (LP: #1572591)
  * Add a 'merge-configs' command to l-c-m which allows merging a specified
    ContainersConfig.json file with the existing config file. (LP: #1566391)
  * Have the Puritine click linking occur before Unity 8 is started to avoid having
    a 0-byte ContainersConfig.json file from being created. (LP: #1573266)

  [ Larry Price ]
  * Fixing infinite package removal on error caused by bad apt command and variable
    access. (LP: #1573201)

  [ CI Train Bot ]
  * No-change rebuild.

libertine (1.0.0+16.04.20160411-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Bind-mount /dev/snd inside LXC container to allow Pulse inside the container
    to work. (LP: #1559087)
  * Fixes needed for using in the Jenkaas smoke testing harness from
    lp:libertine-testing.
  * Support installing Debian packages located on the host into the Libertine
    container. (LP: #1541904)
  * Support localization of GUI strings through Launchpad translations.
    (LP: #1550486)
  * Catch container creation errors and remove the ContainersConfig.json entry
    when those occur. (LP: #1561962)
  * Automatically figure out the correct container type based on the running
    kernel version if the --type option is not given at container creation time.
    (LP: #1561703)
  * Many GUI improvements that should make navigating easier and more intuitive.
  * Run ldconfig.REAL inside chroot based containers after doing updates and
    installing packages. This fixes the issue of missing .so's when applications
    run. (LP: #1566844)
  * Add a file chooser for selecting Debian packages. This file chooser only looks
    in the XDG Download dir (ie, ~/Downloads). (LP: #1555820)
  * Wait for the Libertine Dbus session bridge socket to exist before launching any
    apps in the container. (LP: #1566834)
  * Bump version to 1.0.0.

  [ Larry Price ]
  * Update man page for new options and commands implemented in libertine-
    container-manager, plus add simple man pages for other libertine tools.
  * Update Container Info and Package Info UI to use a gridview to display
    information.

    for PPA's only right now. (LP: #1541901)
  * When killing processes in the container, need to wait() after terminating
    processes and to actually terminate and wait() on the main process.  Caused
    app launching issues in LXC based containers. (LP: #1558588)

  [ Stephen M. Webb ]

  * Add ability to enable or disable i386 multiarch support in a Libertine
    container. (LP: #1518812)

    the programs. (LP: #1541584)
  * Bind mount ~/.config/dconf/ so apps that programs that use it can read
    the correct gsettings data. (LP: #1535421)
  * libertine-container-manager: Add new "--force" option to force installation
    of Ubuntu distros that are no longer supported.

libertine (0.99.9+16.04.20160128-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * puritine-click.conf: Instead of just creating the user-data dir,
    we should actually copy the contents of the click package's user-data
    in case there are things in it we need.
  * GUI: Add a page to the GUI to display basic package info for a
    container.
  * GUI: When using the GUI to install a container, remove the whole
    concept of choosing a distro and just use the host's installed distro
    as the container's distro. (LP: #1533731)
  * GUI: Add an info page for containers that reports various information
    about the chosen container.
  * libertine-container-manager: Add option to run arbitrary commands
    in a container.
  * GUI: Get the package version from the container when viewing the
    package info page.
  * python/libertine/ChrootContainer.py: Workaround issue where a custom
    dconf profile is on a machine.  Of course the profile is not in the
    chroot, so it messes up some applications. (LP: #1536311)
  * debian/control: Revert r155 as this has an unintended effect of pulling
    in the kernel on phones when it's not needed.

libertine (0.99.8+16.04.20160114.1-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Various fixes for making LXC containers work.
  * Refactor libertine-launch to have no explicit dependencies on
    either the LXC or chroot backends. Move specific functions to
    their respective backends.
  * Refactor the discovery of the type of container being used, so
    it's taken care inside of the class.
  * Add new libertine-launch tests.
  * Allow LXC containers access to /dev/dri devices since some X apps
    like to talk to them directly.
  * Fix Depends so that the lxc backend will be installed by default
    if the kernel supports it. Otherwise, fall back to the chroot
    backend.
  * As a temporary fix, disable seccomp when running proot. Fixes
    incompatible kernels. (LP: #1532856, #1532858)

  [ Stephen M. Webb ]
  * libertine-container-manager: added list-apps command
  * python/libertine/AppDiscovery.py: new module for app discovery
