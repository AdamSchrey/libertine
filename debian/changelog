libertine (0.99.9+16.04.20160128-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * puritine-click.conf: Instead of just creating the user-data dir,
    we should actually copy the contents of the click package's user-data
    in case there are things in it we need. 
  * GUI: Add a page to the GUI to display basic package info for a
    container.
  * GUI: When using the GUI to install a container, remove the whole
    concept of choosing a distro and just use the host's installed distro
    as the container's distro. (LP: #1533731)
  * GUI: Add an info page for containers that reports various information
    about the chosen container.
  * libertine-container-manager: Add option to run arbitrary commands
    in a container.
  * GUI: Get the package version from the container when viewing the
    package info page.
  * python/libertine/ChrootContainer.py: Workaround issue where a custom
    dconf profile is on a machine.  Of course the profile is not in the
    chroot, so it messes up some applications. (LP: #1536311)
  * debian/control: Revert r155 as this has an unintended effect of pulling
    in the kernel on phones when it's not needed.

libertine (0.99.8+16.04.20160114.1-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Various fixes for making LXC containers work.
  * Refactor libertine-launch to have no explicit dependencies on
    either the LXC or chroot backends. Move specific functions to
    their respective backends.
  * Refactor the discovery of the type of container being used, so
    it's taken care inside of the class.
  * Add new libertine-launch tests.
  * Allow LXC containers access to /dev/dri devices since some X apps
    like to talk to them directly.
  * Fix Depends so that the lxc backend will be installed by default
    if the kernel supports it. Otherwise, fall back to the chroot
    backend.
  * As a temporary fix, disable seccomp when running proot. Fixes
    incompatible kernels. (LP: #1532856, #1532858)

  [ Stephen M. Webb ]
  * libertine-container-manager: added list-apps command
  * python/libertine/AppDiscovery.py: new module for app discovery

libertine (0.99.6+16.04.20151202.1-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Fix support for LXC based Libertine containers.
  * Fix issue where container creation fails on the last step when
    the compizconfig already exists.
  * Add a new Libertine utils Python3 library that has many of the
    common functions used by all of the tools and Libertine backend.
  * Add a Libertine LXC manager that handles when to start and stop
    a LXC.

  [ ≈Åukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * Add the puritine dummy click framework.

  [ Stephen M. Webb ]
  * libertine-launch: add command line help and a manpage

    enhanced progress reporting to package management
  * refactor lxc and chroot container back ends into separately-installable
    packages

      requirements.
    - Added support for package searches in the container.
    - Set the correct state for container and package installation.

libertine (0.99.4+16.04.20151023-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Add a check to ensure the SUDO_UID and SUDO_GID keys exist in os.environ
    before actually trying to access them.
  * Switch to using the Python libertine-container-manager instead of the C++
    libertine_container_manager.  Simplifies code quite a bit. (LP: #1509472)
  * Fix the hard coded uid to read the actual uid when getting the dbus session
    address.

    starting during package installation.
